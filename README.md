# UFOs Challenge

## Project Overview

The client has provided a JavaScript file of collected UFO sighting information and requested assistance in creating an html page which displays their data. In order to best display the data on the html page, a second JavaScript file was created to allow visitors to the webpage to filter the data to find results matching their interests.

## Results

The html page displays the collected UFO sighting data in an easy to read table format.

In order to best serve future users, a filter function was added to the JavaScript code. Users are able to filter the provided data based on the following criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

The user can filter the data using all five criteria or a single option. For example, the following image shows the results after filtering the data by state.

## Summary

While the current webpage is very user friendly, there is currently no indication for the user what the parameters are for filtering. For example, without scrowling through all of the displayed data, there is no way to know how many dates are collected and which ones are available to be input for filtering. It is recommended that drop down menus be added to the filter criteria which would allow the user to select the parameters rather than fill them in manually. In this way the user will easily be able to tell how many years the data spans; what cities, states, and countries are included; and what type of shapes are cataloged. Additionally, it is suggested to add a "Clear All Filters" button to the search parameters area. This will allow users to more easily adjust their search criteria without needing to refresh the page every time a change is made.
